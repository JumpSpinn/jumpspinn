<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Kevin - Full-Stack Developer</h4>
I'm 29 years old from Dortmund, Germany, and I have gathered 8 years of experience in many areas. Starting with web development, 
up to databases and the communication between server and client. My personal goal is to engage in the tech community and contribute to 
new projects in order to develop myself further and expand my skills. I'm currently doing a retraining program to become a specialist in 
application development, which I'm completing here in Germany. My final exam will take place towards the end of June 2027. After the retraining, 
I would like to work in a company and further develop and demonstrate my skills. When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time relaxing on weekends 
and meeting friends. Nevertheless, I often catch myself thinking about my current projects even then - programmer's disease, as I like to call it.
